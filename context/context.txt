InterServer typically follows a standard Linux hosting directory structure. Based on your previous terminal output, your path follows this pattern:
/home/touthaol/domains/touthaolee.com/public_html/interac

Breakdown:
- /home/touthaol/ — user home directory (username: touthaol)
- /domains/ — contains all domains for your hosting account
- /touthaolee.com/ — specific to your domain
- /public_html/ — web root directory for your domain (publicly accessible)
- /interac/ — subdirectory for your Socket.io project

When configuring your application in cPanel's Node.js manager, use this full path as the application root. The URL path for this directory is:
https://touthaolee.com/interac/

For Passenger configuration on InterServer:
- Place Passengerfile.json in your application directory
- Use tmp/restart.txt to trigger application restarts

These paths are standard for most cPanel hosting environments, though some providers may have slight variations. Let me know if you need more details about InterServer's path structure.


Notes: Do not delete any function that is not working. Fix the function. Always ask and discuss what the funtion that is not working is for.
Ensure the generated HTML code is responsive and optimized for mobile devices.

Edit
I'd be happy to tell you more about the quiz generation functionality in this codebase. Based on my analysis of the code, here are the key aspects of how quizzes are generated:

AI-Powered Quiz Generation
The codebase includes a sophisticated AI-powered quiz generation system that allows admins to create quizzes with minimal effort. The main components of this system are:

1. Quiz Creation Form
In the admin interface (admin.html), there's a "Create New Quiz" section that provides a form for generating quizzes. Key fields include:

Quiz Name
Description
Time per Question (seconds)
Rationale Tone (determines the style of explanations)
AI-specific fields:
Topic/Prompt
Number of Questions
Difficulty Level
2. AI Service Integration
The aiService.js file contains the core functionality for generating quiz questions using AI. It integrates with Google's Generative AI (Gemini) to create questions based on the specified parameters. Key functions include:

generateQuizQuestion: Creates a single multiple-choice question about a given topic
generateQuestions: Creates multiple questions in a batch
generateQuestionsInBatches: Handles creating larger sets of questions while avoiding token limits
generateRationale: Creates explanations for why answers are correct or incorrect
The AI service includes sophisticated error handling, rate limiting, and retry logic to ensure reliable generation even when the AI service is under heavy load.

3. Generation Process
When an admin submits the quiz creation form, the handleCreateQuizSubmit function in admin-quiz.js initiates this process:

It validates the form inputs
Shows a progress UI with real-time updates
Creates the basic quiz structure via API
Uses generateQuizQuestionsInBackground to generate questions asynchronously
Shows progress percentages as questions are generated
Handles errors with retry logic for individual questions
Upon completion, allows the admin to preview or edit the newly created quiz
4. Similarity Checking
The system includes a feature to check for question similarity to avoid redundant or too-similar questions. This is implemented in aiSimilarityService.js which:

Takes a set of questions
Uses AI to analyze their similarity
Reports if any questions are testing the same concept
Admins can trigger this check from the quiz editor by clicking the "Test Similarity" button.

5. Regeneration Capabilities
For individual questions that aren't satisfactory, admins can:

Click the "Regenerate" button next to any question
This calls the regenerateQuestion function from api-client.js
The server uses AI to create a new version of that specific question
The UI updates to show the new question
6. Question Editing
After generation, questions can be manually edited through the quiz edit modal:

Edit question text
Add/remove/modify answer options
Mark which option is correct
Edit the rationales for each option
Technical Implementation Details
The quiz generation process uses several technical approaches to ensure reliability:

Progressive Enhancement: The system first creates the quiz structure, then generates questions in background tasks, allowing for partial success even if some questions fail to generate.
Batched Processing: Questions are generated in small batches (configurable via batchSize) to avoid hitting token limits and to provide more frequent progress updates.
Throttling and Rate Limiting: The code includes sophisticated throttling logic that:
Tracks requests per minute
Implements exponential backoff for retries
Ensures the application stays within API limits
Error Recovery: If a question fails to generate, the system:
Logs the error
Retries up to a configurable number of times
Continues with other questions if a particular one consistently fails
Verification: After generation, the system checks for duplicate or similar questions and allows regeneration of problematic ones.
User Experience Considerations
The quiz generation UI provides a smooth experience through several features:

Real-time Progress: Users see a progress bar and percentage as questions are generated
Time Estimation: The UI displays elapsed time during generation and estimated time remaining
Feedback Mechanisms: Clear success/error toasts communicate outcomes to users
Preview/Edit Flow: After generation, users are prompted to preview or edit the quiz with a single click
Regeneration UI: For individual questions, the regeneration process shows status updates and handles errors gracefully
This comprehensive approach to quiz generation combines AI capabilities with a user-friendly interface, making it easy for administrators to quickly create high-quality quizzes with minimal effort.
