InterServer typically follows a standard Linux hosting directory structure. Based on your previous terminal output, your path follows this pattern:
/home/touthaol/domains/touthaolee.com/public_html/interac

Breakdown:
- /home/touthaol/ — user home directory (username: touthaol)
- /domains/ — contains all domains for your hosting account
- /touthaolee.com/ — specific to your domain
- /public_html/ — web root directory for your domain (publicly accessible)
- /interac/ — subdirectory for your Socket.io project

When configuring your application in cPanel's Node.js manager, use this full path as the application root. The URL path for this directory is:
https://touthaolee.com/interac/

For Passenger configuration on InterServer:
- Place Passengerfile.json in your application directory
- Use tmp/restart.txt to trigger application restarts

These paths are standard for most cPanel hosting environments, though some providers may have slight variations. Let me know if you need more details about InterServer's path structure.
